# Mastermind Game

This is a *mod* of [Steven's Mastermind](https://github.com/TheStevenDev/Mastermind), which unfortunately does NOT really work well - it gives the wrong clues, amongst other shortcomings >.<"

## Improvements
* **Correct** clues are given. (Hopefully it's all fixed).
  * Alternate **'Easy Mode'** to show clues in their positions.
* **Shows answer** at end of game: so no more unresolved cliff hangers.
   * No longer auto-resets. Take your time to study the game and hit 'New Game' only when you're ready to go again =)
   * Shows number of chances/guesses remaining, so game won't end abruptly.
* **Larger slots/circles**: easier to drop colour into. 
* Add missing resources, so that it can be played entirely on its own.
