## How to Play
1. Decide on a colour to play as.
    - `Red` goes 1st, followed by `green`, `blue` and lastly, `purple`. 
    - Player pieces are in the `'decks'` on each of the four sides of the square playing area/`grid`.
            - Player deck(s) will be hidden if there're less than 4 players.
            - In normal mode, pieces are automatically removed from the deck when played.
2. Take turns to place a piece, in the square playing area/`grid`. Try to win!
    - Available moves are shown for the current player as the vertical columns of mini-icons in each grid square. Simply click the piece you want to play, in the grid to be played in.
    - Unlike tic-tac-toe, there are only 3 pieces of each size and colour. Choose wisely.
3. Game ends when a player wins, or all players run out of pieces.

### Winning Conditions
There are **3** ways to win. See game page itself for diagrams.
1. Form a **straight line** of **same size** pieces of your colour.
2. Form a **straight line** of **big to medium to small** (or vice versa) pieces of your colour. Sizes must be in sequence, i.e. medium sized piece must be in the middle of the line!
3. Form a **concentric** circle of 3 of your pieces (all different sizes).

Lines can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
